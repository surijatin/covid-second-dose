# Covid-19 Vaccine Second Jab

The web application is hosted [here](https://surijatin.github.io/covid-second-dose) via github pages.

Instead of manually calculating the date for the second dose of vaccine, the main idea behind creating this web application is to provide user with an interactive UI and reduce the manual effort. The 
Currently the GOI is administering only below listed vaccines - 
⋅⋅* Covishield
⋅⋅* Covaxin
⋅⋅* Sputnik V
⋅⋅* Moderna

The gap between two doses for each of the vaccines will be calculated as per the days mentioned in the below table -

| Vaccine    | No. of days between 2 doses |
| ---------- | ---------------------------:|
| Covishield | 84                          |
| Covaxin    | 28                          |
| Sputnik V  | 21                          |
| Moderna    | 28                          | 

The web application is built on React.JS framework. Will be adding more features to it soon.
